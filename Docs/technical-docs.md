The `ipv6_cidr_block = cidrsubnet(aws_vpc.ekscape.ipv6_cidr_block, 8, 1)` line in Terraform is generating an IPv6 CIDR block for the subnet based on the VPC's IPv6 CIDR block.

Let's break down the `cidrsubnet` function in this context:

### Syntax of `cidrsubnet`:

`cidrsubnet(base_cidr_block, new_bits, subnet_num)`

- **`base_cidr_block`**: This is the base CIDR block from which new subnets will be created. In this case, `aws_vpc.ekscape.ipv6_cidr_block` is the IPv6 CIDR block assigned to the VPC.
- **`new_bits`**: The number of additional bits to extend the subnet mask. For IPv6, a CIDR block is often allocated with `/56` or `/64`. Here, you're specifying 8 additional bits, which allows for creating up to 256 (2^8) subnets within the base IPv6 range.
- **`subnet_num`**: This determines which subnet to create. Itâ€™s a number that Terraform uses to create a specific range of addresses within the larger IPv6 block. The number `1` in this case indicates the first subnet within the `cidrsubnet` function's output.

### Example:

Assume your VPC has an IPv6 CIDR block like `2600:1f18:17ac::/56`.

When you use:

`ipv6_cidr_block = cidrsubnet(aws_vpc.ekscape.ipv6_cidr_block, 8, 1)`

This means:

1. **Base CIDR block**: `2600:1f18:17ac::/56`
2. **New subnet mask**: `/56 + 8 = /64` (because the `new_bits` is 8, it extends the CIDR block by 8 bits, creating subnets with a `/64` prefix).
3. **Subnet number 1**: The function generates the first subnet in the range, for example, `2600:1f18:17ac:1::/64`.

If you change the `subnet_num` (e.g., `2`), it will generate a different range, for example, `2600:1f18:17ac:2::/64`.

### Why use `cidrsubnet`?

The `cidrsubnet` function allows you to programmatically and predictably split a larger CIDR block (like your VPC's IPv6 block) into smaller subnets without manually calculating the new IPv6 ranges. By adjusting the `subnet_num`, you ensure that each subnet gets a unique, non-overlapping IPv6 range.

## How Helm Works

- Helm uses a packaging format called charts. A chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources.
- Helm is primarily a client-side tool. You install it on your local machine or the machine you use to manage your Kubernetes clusters.
- How to check to context you are connected to you can use `kubect config current-context` or `helm version --short`

## Key Concepts

1. **Charts**:
    - Helm packages are called charts
    - They contain all resource definitions necessary to run an application, tool, or service inside a Kubernetes cluster
    - Charts are created as files laid out in a particular directory tree, then packaged into versioned archives to be deployed
2. **Releases**:
    - When a chart is installed, the Helm library creates a release to track that installation
    - One chart can be installed multiple times into the same cluster, and each can be independently managed and upgraded
3. **Repositories**:
    - Places where charts can be collected and shared
    - They're similar to Perl's CPAN archive or the Fedora Package Database, but for Kubernetes packages

## How It Works

1. **Chart Development**:
    - Developers create Helm charts that define Kubernetes resources
    - Charts include templates and default values
2. **Chart Storage**:
    - Charts are stored in Helm repositories or local directories
3. **Installation**:
    - Users install charts into Kubernetes clusters using Helm CLI
    - Helm renders the templates using the provided or default values
    - Helm uses the Kubernetes API to create the resources in the cluster
4. **Release Management**:
    - Helm keeps track of each installation, allowing for upgrades and rollbacks
5. **Templating**:
    - Helm uses Go templates to enable dynamic generation of manifest files
    - This allows for customization and reuse of charts across different environments
6. **How it works**:
    - You run Helm commands on your local machine.
	- Helm uses your local Kubernetes configuration (usually in `~/.kube/config`) to connect to your EKS cluster.
	- When you install or upgrade charts, Helm sends the rendered Kubernetes manifests to the Kubernetes API server of your EKS cluster.


## Key Components

1. **Helm CLI**: The command-line client that sends commands to the Kubernetes API server
2. **Charts**: The Helm packaging format
3. **Kubernetes API Server**: Helm interacts with the Kubernetes cluster through the API server

## Workflow Example

1. `helm repo add`: Add a chart repository
2. `helm search`: Search for charts
3. `helm install`: Install a chart into the cluster, creating a new release
4. `helm status`: Check the release status
5. `helm upgrade`: Upgrade a release to a new version of the chart
6. `helm rollback`: Roll back a release to a previous version
